# 2022_DecoderForDetector

Code (python) that decodes the TDC data from HUL unit that is in binary format. The program is used to read binary TDC data and convert it into text-based ”readable” data. 

This was written in order to test FGATI board version 5 (GN-1809-5) and HR-TDC (GN-1644-1) to use for the development of positron dectectors in muon spin spectroscopy.
